# Drysuit-Heater-Controller
Uses an Arduino to control a drysuit heater using pulse width modulation.  I designed it for the Adafruit Trinket but any Arduino should work.  The program allows you to set the length of the cycle, currently set at 2 seconds.  There are 3 settings, currently 50%, 75% and 100% duty cycles. You can change these to whatever you want.  The controller is designed to be controlled by a single toggle switch.  Every time you turn the heater on, it switches to the next heater setting in the loop Low, Med, Hi, Low Med Hi.  It includes 3 indicator LEDs; One for each power setting.  The on board LED is used to show when the heater is being cycled for testing and troubleshooting.
